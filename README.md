# C# Console Renderer

This thing is super slow but allows for some real weird ways of rendering stuff, since it renders everything with whitespaces and coloured backgrounds on the terminal.
You need to set the font size of your terminal super low for it to even run.

Eventually used this for a really messy raymarcher.
